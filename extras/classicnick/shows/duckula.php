         <p align="center">&quot;<font size="2">Castle Duckula.. Home to many a dreadful dynasty of vicious vampire ducks, the Counts of Duckula.<br>
           Legend has it that these foul beings can be destroyed by a stake through the heart or exposure to sunlight.<br>
           This does not suffice, however, for they may be brought back to life, by means of a secret rite that can be performed once a century, when the moon is in the eighth house of Aquarius..&quot;<br>
           Igor: &quot;..bat wings, blood..&quot;<br>
           Nanny: &quot;I'll get it.&quot;<br>
         &quot;The Latest reincarnation did not run according to plan.&quot; </p>
         <p align="center">[theme song]<br>
         &quot;In the heart of Transylvania, in the vampire hall of fang-ya, there's not a vampire zanier than DUCKULA.<br>
           He won't bite beast or man, cause he's a vegetarian and things never run to plan for DUCKULA.<br>
           If you're looking for some fun, you can always count upon the wild and wacky one they call DUCKULA.&quot;</p>
         <p align="center">[closing]<br>
         &quot;If you're feeling (ahhh) or you're a little...., maybe you've run into DUCKULA.<br>
           If your knees go (knock) or your teeth go (chatter) maybe you've bumped into DUCKULA.<br>
           He flies through the night, looking for a bite, but he's back here by daylight. DUCKULA.<br>
           If you're sort of... or you're a little (cuckoo), it's certain you've run into DUCKULA.<br>
           If your heart goes (thump thump) or your mind goes (crazy), man you've had a brush with DUCKULA.<br>
           So, what out for the..., beware of the... and pray you'll never meet with DUCKULA.</font>&quot;<br>

         <p align="justify"><strong>Castle Duckula</strong></p>
         <p align="justify"><em>Count Duckula</em> was produced by Cosgrove Hall Productions, and was a spinoff of Danger Mouse. It was about a vegetarian vampire duck named Duckula, his brooding butler Igor, and his dim-witted maid Nanny. When Duckula was resurrected last, Igor accidentally used ketchup instead of blood, and as a result Duckula hates blood and is a vegetarian. Duckula has a dream of getting into show biz, and is constantly trying to fulfill that ambition, much to the dismay of Igor who wishes Duckula was more evil. </p>
