         <p align="justify">Aired on Nick (SNICK) from Aug, 15, 1992 until Feb. 3, 1996, then was revived with new episodes around 1999.</p>
         <p align="justify"><strong>Are You Scared?</strong></p>
         <p align="justify"><em>Are You Afraid of the Dark</em> was one of the old school shows of SNICK (Saturday Nigh Nickelodeon) from the days of the big orange couch. It incorporated the age old tradition of telling ghost stories around a fire into a fascinating new show, which was somewhat akin too <em>The Twilight Zone</em>, <em>Tales From The Darkside</em>, and <em>Tales From The Crypt</em>.</p>
         <p align="justify">The group of kids who met in the woods near a campfire to tell ghost stories called themselves &quot;The Midnight Society,&quot; and the original members included: Gary, Kristen, Kiki, Eric, David, and Betty Ann. The leader of the group was Gary. At the beginning of each story, the person telling the story would always through some flammable substance into the fire, causing it to flair up. The stories took center stage, thus the regular characters were fairly minor. </p>
         <p align="justify">During the course of the series, a few members new members to the Midnight Society entered to replace existing ones, most notably Sam, Stig and Tucker (Gary's younger brother).</p>
         <p align="justify">Since the Midnight Society was only seen at the beginning and end of the show, <em>Are You Afraid of the Dark</em> relied heavily on guest stars, the most prominent of whom included Melissa Joan Hart (of Clarissa Explains it All), and Will Friedle (of <em>Boy Meets World</em>, and earlier, Nickelodeon's <em>Don't Just Sit There!</em>).</p>
         <p align="justify">A new series has been made of this show, featuring an entire new Midnight Society, with the lone exception of Tucker, who is now the leader (apparently nepotism exists in this group).</p>
