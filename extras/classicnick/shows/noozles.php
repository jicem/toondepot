         <p align="justify"><em>The Noozles</em> was a light cartoon show that made use of Koalas. The show centered on the adventures of Sandy, a twelve year old girl, a stuffed koala bear named Blinky that came to life when you rubbed your nose with his, and Blinky's sister Pinky (who had the same voice as Angelica from Rugrats). This show was Japanese in origin (?).</p>
         <p align="justify">Blinky and Pinky came from Koala-Wala Land, a parallel universe to ours. By the end of the series, they return there. Among the other characters in the series are Sandy's mother, Alex Brown, who was Sandy's father, who was an archeologist and traveled around a lot, Franky and Spike, who were two thugs, Osgood, a lizard from Koala-Wala Land, and the High Dingy Doo, the ruler of Koala-Wala Land.</p>
