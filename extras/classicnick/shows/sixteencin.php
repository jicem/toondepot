         <p align="justify"><em>Sixteen Cinema</em> was similar to <em>Special Delivery</em> in that it aired after school specials and mini-series, but it was much more serious than Special Delivery. The programming it aired usually dealt with growing up, and the trials and tribulations that often accompanied it. It was sad at times. I don't really remember a whole lot about it, but I remember it aired <em>Revenge of the Nerd</em> once. Can anyone out there help me? </p>
