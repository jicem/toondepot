         <p>Premiered in the UK in 1965.</p>
         <p align="justify"><em>The Magic Roundabout</em>, like many of the animated cartoons that aired on Pinwheel, was very bizarre, yet it was entertaining. Originally this cartoon was written in French, but was translated for the BBC.</p>
         <p align="justify">The reoccurring characters were Brian, Dylan, Dougal, Zebedee, Old Mr. MacHenry, Florence, and Ermintrude. I don't really remember much about the series, but I remember how Zebedee would always bounce around on a springs and announce: &quot;Here I am!&quot; followed by some nonsense word (I think) that rhymed with &quot;am.&quot;</p>
