         <p align="justify">This show was created in the wake of Nick's other hit game show <em>Double Dare</em>, and included much messy fun. It was always the Red Team vs. The Blue team, and started out as kids tried to find small pictures that were hidden in larger pictures. For each one they found, they won $25.</p>
         <p align="justify">After the hidden picture rounds, the kids searched through rooms of a house to find an object. If they found the object in thirty seconds, they won $50, but if they didn't, the opposing team won the money.</p>
         <p align="justify">After this, the sequence was repeated again, only the stakes were raised to $75 per picture and $100 per object. There was also a bonus round where a team could win an extra prize. As with Double Dare, no one went home empty handed.</p>
         <p align="justify">The show's original host was Wesley Eure, but in 1987 Larry Toffler took over. This was also the year Finders Keepers went into syndication. John Harvey (known simply as &quot;Harvey&quot;, of Double Dare Fame), was also the original announcer.</p>
         <p align="justify">In 1998, the concept was revived by a British game show, but it has yet to cross the Atlantic. </p>
