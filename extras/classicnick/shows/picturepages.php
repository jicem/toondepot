         <p align="justify"><em>Picture Pages</em> originated on <em>Captain Kangaroo</em> in the 1970s and was hosted by the Captain himself. The show sought to teach preschoolers lessons through colorful lessons by using a workbook. In 1978, Bill Cosby became the host of Picture Pages, along with his trusty pencil, Mortimer Icobod Marker, and occasionally &quot;The Mighty Mi&quot;. In 1984, Captain Kangaroo left TV, and Picture Pages was without a home until Nickelodeon picked it up and began running it during episodes of Pinwheel where it ran throughout the rest of the 1980s. There were 260 shorts that aired on Nickelodeon, and taught viewers about shapes, numbers, colors, animals and much more. </p>
