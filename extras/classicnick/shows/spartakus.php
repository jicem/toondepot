         <p align="center"><font size="2">&quot;Ever since the time of the Great Cataclysm, the Arkadians have lived deep in the center of the Earth. Their civilization thrived under the power of their sun, the Tehra... until it began to fail. In desperation, the children of Arkadia broke the law, and entered the forbidden Archives searching for a solution. What they discovered gave them hope. Anxiously, they used their special powers and created a messenger for the people above. They named her Arkana..&quot;</font></p>

         <p align="justify"><strong>The Quest</strong></p>
         <p align="justify"><em>Spartakus And The Sun Beneath The Sea</em> was a French cartoon that told the story of a great quest. In some respects, it was similar to <em>The Mysterious Cities of Gold</em> in that it was a mix of fantasy, myth, science fiction, and history.</p>
         <p align="center"><img src="spartakus4.gif" width="316" height="216"></p>
         <p align="justify">Thousands of years ago, a highly advanced civilization thrived on the surface of the Earth. Then something terrible occurred: The Great Cataclysm, which destroyed most traces of it. The Arkadians believed they where the only survivors of the Cataclysm, and rebuilt their civilization in the center of the Earth, relying on an artificial sun, known as the Tehra. They also decreed that no future Arkaidians should know of their past when they lived on the surface. Only the Tehrig, a flying machine, was allowed in the Archives.</p>
         <p align="justify">Eventually, when the Tehra began to fail, the children realized that the Archives would be their only hope. They used their powers to create Arkana, who was made to resemble a surface dweller. They sent her, along with two anteater like creatures, Bic and Bac, to the surface aboard Tehrig in an attempt to get help.</p>
         <p align="justify">The story began when siblings Matt and Rebecca where exploring an underground river when they met Arkana, Bic, Bac, and Tehrig. They were then attacked by the Pirates. Luckily, Spartakus was nearby, and ran to their aid. They were able to defeat the Pirates, and Spartakus, Matt, and Rebecca joined them in their quest to save Arkadia. Matt realized that, since time is different inside the Earth than it is on the surface, he and Rebecca would probably get home in time for supper.</p>
         <p align="justify">Along the way, they would have many adventures. They were searching for the Auracite. They found the first one, but discovered that the Tehra could not be restored until the found the second one. Of course, the Pirates would often harass them. The Pirates consisted of Nasty Max, Mighty Matt, Sleazeappeal, Ringnar, and Massmedia. They traveled around the Earth, searching for people to capture and sell into slavery, and things to steal. They also had their own television network, and were members of the &quot;Intrastrata Marine Pirate Federation&quot;. They also had a song they often sang (&quot;We are pirates upon the high seas...&quot;).</p>
         <p align="justify">Eventually it was revealed that the second Auracite was in fact the people of Arkadia. Thus they were then able to save the Tehra. In the final episode, Arkadia left the center of the Earth and headed towards outer space, as Matt and Rebecca looked on from a beach near their home. They then saw the Pirate ship sailing off into the sunset. Then they ran home so they wouldn't be late for supper.<br>
