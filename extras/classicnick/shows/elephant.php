         <p align="justify">The wacky adventures of singers Sharon, Lois, Bram, and some guy in a elephant costume as they traveled around. They were usually accompanied by kids, and their shows contained clips from their concerts, short skits, and other stuff. They sang songs about radom things, and helped kids with their problems, often incorporating music. My personal favorite episode was the one where everything was backwards (as if somebody running around 24-7 in an elephant costume wasn't wierd enough). </p>
