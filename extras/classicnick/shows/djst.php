         <p align="justify"><em>Don't Just Sit There </em>was a skit/variety/talk show, that featured the band Out of Order, which included members Chris, Buck, Mike, and Ed Jahn (keyboards). It was hosted by four teenagers. They where Matt Brown, Ali Smith, Wendy, and B.J. It often had musical guests, including New Kid's on the Block (I hated them even then). Kelly Brown, who played Brad on <em>Hey Dude</em> also appeared on it once (DJST aired at the same time that <em>Hey Dude</em> was being originally produced). Also, William M. &quot;Bill&quot; Gaines, who created E.C. Comics and <em>Mad Magazine</em> also appeared once.</p>
         <p align="justify">I remember a few particular episodes: Once they had a day when only girls were supposed to watch (talk about sexist), and once there was a day that they gave us off, when we were actually discouraged from watching (How's that for reverse psychology?). Matt also dressed up as a pimple once. That's about all I know about it. Can anyone out there help me?</p>
         <p align="justify">Sen78 says: &quot;I don't remember [Bill Gaines] being on that show, however <em>Mad Magazine's </em>Dick DeBartolo was on the show twice. Also I remember musical appearances by the Jets and Menudo.... after [the Jets] performed, the hosts of the show had the band members fly paper airplanes and make plane noises (cause they're the JETS, get it, ha).&quot;</p>
         <p align="justify">tparets says:</p>
         <p align="justify">&quot;Back in 1989 and 1990 when I was 14 and 15 I was infatuated with Matt Brown and my friend and I were devoted fans of the show. I hadn't thought about it in a long while until I found your page and it brought back and many memories. One story I would like to share is one time my friend and I called information in NY and NJ to try to get phone numbers to the stars of the show. We really didn't think we would have any luck but we found a number for Chris Guice(the lead guitarist and singer for Out Of Order) It turned out that Matt Brown and Mike Baldwin were over at his house and we talked to them for an hour and a half. I have some of the conversation on tape somewhere. We also got a number for Ed Jahn and my friend called him. When I was in NJ visiting my cousin back in 1990 he took me past Ed's house. I also have a picture of it somewhere....&quot;</p>
         <p align="justify">tparets also supplies the following information:</p>
         <p align="justify">&quot;-BJ was only on the first year and then he left(I always wondered why)</p>
         <p align="justify">-The band got more involved in skits as the show went on.</p>
         <p align="justify">-The earlier episodes had stuff like &quot;Joke of the Day&quot; and segments called &quot;Quickies&quot; which I think were like quick little informative skits or something.</p>
         <p align="justify">-There was a video sold in stores called &quot;The Don't Just Sit There Survival Guide&quot;</p>
         <p align="justify">-At the beggining of every episode they would talk to people on the street.</p>
         <p align="justify">-The band sometimes wrote original songs they would sing</p>
         <p align="justify">-They did alot of musical numbers for example I remember Alie singing a song called &quot;Sing While you do the Dishes&quot; and one called &quot;Rock Librarian&quot; Then once Matt dressed up as a rat and preformed a rap.</p>
         <p align="justify"><strong>Where they are now:</strong></p>
         <p align="justify">The following information came from Ed Jahn, keyboardist for the band Out of Order, which appeared on the show:</p>
         <p align="justify">&quot;Buck and Chris are still doing their individual music thing, still playing with various bands on the east coast and doing other studio work. Mike Baldwin is also back east but works outside the music or television biz. I'm [Ed Jahn] producing a Pacific Northwest environmental television series with PBS. I pretty much stopped playing keys shortly after high school and got heavily into the outdoors/ environmental side of life.&quot;</p>
         <p align="justify">&quot;Matt Brown is doing a variety of things- most of all having fun, sticking mostly in the New York City area. Ali Smith was last seen in California, but nobody has heard from her in a while. I don't know where Wendy Douglas or BJ Schaffer are these days. Will Friedel, who was a co-host for a while as well, has gone on to do some pretty major television works- I think even a prime time show this past year- but to tell you the truth, I'm not all that up on what's happening in the commercial television world.&quot;</p>
         <p align="justify">&quot;....after the show ended, which was a great time in all our lives, we all pretty much went out and did what most folks do- college, work, have fun, experience life.&quot;</p>
         <p align="justify">From Bernard (B.J.) Schaffer, co-host of the show: &quot;...I am a police officer in Pennsylvania. I'm happily married and have a new son. Besides that I'm a writter and have published a couple short stories.&quot;</p>
         <p align="justify">Special Thanks goes to Ed Jahn and Bernard (B.J.) Schaffer, for contacting me and allowing me to post this information. Ed adds that he has kept in occasional touch with all the members of Out of Order, and with Matt Brown, but is not sure what ever happened to Ali, Wendy, or BJ.</p>
