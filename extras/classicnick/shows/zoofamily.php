         <p align="justify">One of the lesser remembered shows of Classic Nick is <em>Zoo Family</em>. It was originally produced in Australia, and aired there in 1985-1986. It appeared on the First Network for Kids in 1987. I believe it did not air long on Nick, and that may have been the only time it aired in the states. It was filmed on location in the Royal Melbourne Zoo, in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
         <p align="justify">In any event, as the title suggests, it was about a family that lived in a zoo. The father, Mitch, worked for the zoo, so the children got to live a dream of many. Sadly, I remember little about it. If anyone out there has any info, I would appreciate it! </p>
