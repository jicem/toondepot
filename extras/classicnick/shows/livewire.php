         <p align="justify"><em>Livewire</em> was a talk show type format show, and a Cable Ace winner. It was hosted by Fred Newman, and featured a live kid audience. In this show, various topics were discussed, and it was aimed at 12 to 15 year olds. There were also many guests, and I am told that the group R.E.M. even made a very early appearance on this show. Among the topics discussed were drugs, abortion, and much more. Definitely a quality show. </p>
