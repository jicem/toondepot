         <p align="justify"><em>Special Delivery</em> aired on Saturday afternoons in the 1980s and early 90s, and showed after school type specials, and Canadian dramas. It included both animated and live-action material, but I believe the majority of it were live-action. The material shown included: <em>Chocky</em>, <em>Silver City</em>, <em>Raggedy Ann and Andy</em>, <em>Peanut Butter Solution</em>, and many others. </p>
