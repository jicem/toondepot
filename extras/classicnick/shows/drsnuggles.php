         <p align="justify"><em>Doctor Snuggles</em> was Dutch in origin, but seemed to be British influenced. The show had only thirteen episodes to its credit and aired briefly on Nick sometime around 1988. The show was syndicated in 1981.<br>

         <p align="justify">Doctor Snuggles was a kindly inventor and a little on the obese side (better for Snuggling). He traveled around on a pogo stick, and lived in a magical world where everything from animals to sheds could talk, and often went on adventures throughout the world. There was a large cast of characters: his lab assistant Dennis the Badger, housekeeper Miss Nettles, Knobby the Mouse, Granny Toots and her Cosmic Cat, Rickety Rick, Winnie Vinegar Bottle, and many others.</p>
         <p align="justify">Doctor Snuggles seems to be one of the least remembered cartoon shows of the 1980s. It aired on Nick at 11:00 am EST very briefly, probably because there were only 13 episodes made. It still airs in some parts of the world in syndication, and there have also been picture books of Dr. Snuggles.</p>
