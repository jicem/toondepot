         <p align="justify"><em>Double Dare</em>, the first ever kids' game show, and the first game show that aired on Nick, began production in 1986, at WHYY Studios, in Philadelphia, PA. Marc Summers became the host, beating former Family Challenge host Michael Burger. Marc Summers did an excellent job as host, even though he suffered from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, like many people, and was obsessed with cleanliness.</p>
         <p align="justify">On September 18, 1986, the first episode of Double Dare was taped. It went fairly smoothly, with the exception of the obstacle course having to be started over four times. Double Dare would go on to triple Nickelodeon's ratings. In 1986, Nick was still very much a young network, and Double Dare helped put it on the map.</p>
         <p align="justify">Double Dare always started with two teams competing in a messy physical challenge for control of the board. The physical challenges usually consisted of slime, maple syrup, oatmeal, jelly, or any other messy substance. The team that won this event would control the board, which meant that all the questions would be asked to them. When they came to a question they didn't know the answer to, or thought the other team didn't know, they could dare them to answer it for double the amount (the original amount that a question was worth began at $10). The other team could always double-dare the original team to answer it for four times the amount. Then the team would have to either answer the question or take a physical challenge, which was always messy.</p>
         <p align="justify">Teams always left with at least $100. When one team won the game, they would then get to run through the obstacle course. For every obstacle completed in sixty seconds, the team won a prize. If all the obstacles were completed, then the team won a big prize, usually a trip to Space Camp or Disney World.</p>
         <p align="justify">Double Dare spawned many spinoffs including Family Double Dare, which aired on Fox during prime time for a while, Super Sloppy Double Dare, All Star Double Dare, and the recently reincarnated Double Dare 2000. Double Dare was also responsible for the influx of game shows on Nick during the 1980s (Finder's Kepeers, Make The Grade, Get The Picture, etc.). Marc Summers also went on to host<em> What Would You Do?</em> which aired on Nick in the mid 1990s.</p>
