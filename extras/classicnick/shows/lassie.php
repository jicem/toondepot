         <p><strong>Lassie</strong></p>
         <p align="center"><img src="Image55.jpg" width="309" height="288"></p>
         <p align="justify">Lassie is an icon in animal/human friendship. Interestingly enough, there were six collies who portrayed Lassie, and all were male.</p>
         <p align="justify">Lassie first appeared in 1943 in the film Lassie Come Home, and later got her own show on the radio, before arriving on television in 1954. Originally Lassie was paired with Jeff Miller, his widowed mother, and grandfather (known simply as &quot;Gramps&quot;). This lasted for three years, until Jeff became to old. Thus the Martins entered the picture, and they are the family I remember the most.</p>
         <p align="justify">That's not to say that they were better than the Miller's, they were just the family I saw first when Lassie aired on Nick. The Martins bought the house from Jeff's family as they left for the city, and they had only recently adopted Timmy. Jeff, realizing that Timmy would probably need Lassie more than he would, and also that Lassie would not be happy in the city, decided to leave Lassie behind. And thus began Lassie's adventures with Timmy.</p>

         <p align="justify">Timmy had a couple friends, the most notable of which was &quot;Boomer&quot;. Another friend of the Martins was Cully Wilson, who would eventually have Lassie for a brief period of time. Cully also had a dog of his own, named Sam. Sam was a bloodhound, but he couldn't smell. This was embarrassing to Cully, who hid it from everyone except Timmy, though Timmy's mother Ruth figured it out on her own. Unfortunately Sam died during the course of the series, and it was indeed a very sad episode.</p>
         <p align="justify">Eventually, Timmy too became to old for the part, and this time the writers elected to have Lassie aligned with an adult. The Martin's decided to move to Australia as part of a Grange Exchange (I think). If Lassie came, she would have to be quarantined, so they decided to leave her with Cully Wilson. Cully then became sick, and Lassie ran to Forest Ranger Corey Stewart for help. Cully decided that Stewart was better suited for taking care of Lassie than he was, and gave Lassie to him.</p>
         <p align="justify">Lassie stayed with Stewart for a while, and got into even greater adventures. Eventually Stewart gave her to two other Rangers, but Lassie went free, and roamed the countryside for two years. During her last season, Lassie took up residence with Keith Holden at his ranch.</p>
         <p align="justify">Lassie certainly had many adventures during her original amazing seventeen year run on network TV. A new movie and television series have been recently made. We can only hope that the original will eventually return to TV. </p>
