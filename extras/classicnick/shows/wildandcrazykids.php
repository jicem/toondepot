         <p align="justify"><strong>Crazy Kids</strong></p>
         <p align="justify">This show was a game show of sorts that basically involved kids competing in (sometimes off the wall) athletic activities. It used the same formula as many early Nick game shows of dividing kids into color teams. Sometimes it would pit kids vs. their parents. Hosts Omar Gooding, Annette Chavez and Donnie Jeffcoat traveled all over America in search of action.</p>
         <p align="justify">This show debuted about the same time as<em> SK8 TV</em>, but remained on Nick for a much longer span of time.</p>
