         <p>Joe from Chicago hosted<em> Nick Rocks</em>, which was a showcase of music videos selected by kids. It aired on Sunday mornings, around 11 am I think. Though I can't remember any of the videos that were shown, I'd be willing to bet New Kids On The Block had some stuff on there. Despite this, Nick Rocks was a quality show. It also seems to have inspired<em> Nick Jr. Rocks</em>, which were childrens songs that aired between shows on Nick Jr. </p>
