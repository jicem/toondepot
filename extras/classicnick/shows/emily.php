         <p align="justify"><em>Emily</em> was about a little girl named Emily who always wore a red hat and red clothes &quot;but sometimes [her] gloves are green.&quot; She had an older brother named Stephen (not sure about spelling), and a hedgehog named Humphrey. It also had a neato-keen theme song that I can't remember. I'd almost bet that this was European in origin, but I'm not sure. </p>
