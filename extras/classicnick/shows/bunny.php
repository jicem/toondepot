         <p align="justify">The rabbit lived in a suitcase. At the beginning of every segment, he would come out of the suitcase, and look at the town through a telescope. When he saw someone being bullied, he would use his large ears like a helicopter, and fly to there aid. He was a peacemaker. In the end, he'd always return to the suitcase. </p>
