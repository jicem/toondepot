         <p align="justify">Paddington Bear was very civilized for a bear, especially one from &quot;Darkest Peru&quot;. He came to England, and was taken in by the Brown family. Paddington always carried an umbrella, and wore a raincoat. A lover of anything with marmalade, Paddigton was a stuffed animal and the humans that were in the skits were cardboard cut outs. He had some grouchy neighbors as well. </p>
