         &quot;And not it's time for the show!&quot;</font></p>
         <p align="justify">Aired on Nick from Sept. 12, 1988 until Sept. 11, 1999.</p>
         <p align="justify"><strong>It's Time For The Show</strong></p>
         <p align="justify"><em>Looney Tunes</em> was a collection of classic Warner Brothers cartoons that featured Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Roadrunner and Wily E. Coyote, among others.</p>
         <p align="justify">When they first debuted on Nick in 1988, Nickelodeon had only a limited supply of cartoons available for airing. These included colorized Porky Pig cartoons, some post-1960 Bugs Bunny, Sylvester and Tweety, and others, and some black-and-white cartoons, usually Bosko, Buddy, or Porky Pig. The reason for this was that most of the more popular segments were shown exclusively on ABC's <em>Bugs Bunny &amp; Tweety Show</em>. Even so, Nick's Looney Tunes had a successful run. Nick would often run random shorts during the day between regular programming. Around 1989, Nick aired a week long special of &quot;Marc Summer's Favorite Looney Tunes&quot; in honor of the Double Dare host.</p>
         <p align="justify">In 1994, there was some shuffling of cartoons between networks which resulted in Nick obtaining the rights to air more cartoons. Nick hyped this fact by running adds stating that Nick would now air &quot;more of the Looney Tunes you want,&quot; which included Bugs Bunny, Tweety, Daffy Duck, and &quot;no Bosko&quot;. They also dropped their black-and-white cartoons.</p>
         <p align="justify">Looney Tunes was very successful in it's almost eleven year run on the first kid's network. Nick even aired (albeit briefly) Tiny Toon Adventures. In September, 1999 Looney Tunes relocated to <em>The Cartoon Network</em>.</p>
