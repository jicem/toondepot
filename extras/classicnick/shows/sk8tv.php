         <p align="justify">A Nick show dedicated to skating, <em>Sk8 TV</em> lasted only one season on The First Kid's Network. It basically showed highlights, and interviewed skaters. If I remember correctly, it debuted at the same time as <em>Wild and Crazy Kids</em>, but was much shorter lived. </p>
