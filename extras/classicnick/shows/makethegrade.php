         <p><strong>Making the Grade</strong></p>
         <p align="justify"><em>Make The Grade</em> was a <em>Jeopardy</em> type game in which contestants would pick squares that were divided by grade levels (Elementary, 7-12), and subjects. To win, you had to answer one correctly in each subject, and one in each grade level. There were also random fire drills that would screw with the contestants. </p>
