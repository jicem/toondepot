         <p align="justify">Featuring the voice of Don Adams (&quot;Maxwell Smart&quot;, of Get Smart) as Inspector Gadget, a clueless, robotically enhanced police inspector.</p>
         <p align="justify">Inspector Gadget had a gadget for every situation imaginable. He was world renowned for his detective skills, but his niece Penny and trusty dog Brain always followed close behind, and in reality solved the case.</p>
        <p align="justify">Gadget always received his assignments for the day from Police Chief Quimby. They were always printed on self destructing paper that always blew up in Quimby's face, creating one of the most classic reoccurring jokes in any cartoon. Gadget's assignment always included battling MAD, an evil organization headed by Dr. Claw. Dr. Claw himself seemed to be highly intelligent (much more so than Gadget), but his henchman were bumbling and incompetent, perhaps even more so than the Inspector . His face was never revealed on the cartoon show, we only saw his arm. This created a great deal of mystery behind Claw. Claw was always accompanied by his faithful feline, Madcat.</p>

           wenlar supplies the following information:</p>
         <p align="justify">&quot;The series was a french/japanese co-production between D.IC audio/visual paris and the tokyo movie shinsha... The voices were recorded in Canada (Toronto, to be exact) but no other work was done there. The original script was written in France, and the animation was handeled almost entirely in Japan (although a few episodes were done by the ultra-cheap Cookoo's nest studios in Taiwan). A number of famous artists and producers worked on this, including Shingo Araki(Ulysess 31, Rupan III) Tetsuo Katayama (Godmars, Space Adventure Cobra) and Shigeru Akagawa (art director on the new WB cartoon &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh&quot;) and many others. I know these cartoons reffered to may be obscure to you, but keep in mind that these series got little to no distribution in North America, but were extremely popular in the Land of the Rising Sun.&quot;<br>

         <p align="justify">Later in the show's run, Corporal Capeman made his debut. He was an ally of Gadget, and believed that he could actually fly. Apparently, his character didn't fly, because he did not last very long. He was last seen leaving for Secret Agent School.</p>
         <p align="justify">Inspector Gadget ran for 86 episodes, and was truly one of the best cartoons of all time. It successfully established itself an identity, with the reoccurring Quimby getting blown up gag, Penny and Brain always solving the cases, and Gadget's luck the never seemed to run out. Tons of memorable quotes included: &quot;I'm always on Duty&quot; (Gadget), &quot;I'll get you next time Gadget... Next time!&quot; (Dr. Claw), &quot;I don't know how you did it Gadget&quot; (Quimby).</p>
         <p align="justify">In 1999, Matthew Broderick and Rupert Everett starred in the Disney movie Inspector Gadget. Though the movie is not 100% faithful to the original cartoon, it is enjoyable and entertaining to watch.</p>
