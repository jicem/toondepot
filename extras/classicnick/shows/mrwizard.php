         <p align="justify">Don Herbert gained great fame as Mr. Wizard, and became the most well-known science teacher in the world. </p>
         <p align="justify">During World War II he was a pilot, and later became an actor before becoming &quot;Mister Wizard.&quot; <em>Watch Mr. Wizard</em> was Don Herbert's first appearance as Mr. Wizard, and it soon caught on. Watch Mr. Wizard ran on NBC from 1951-1965, then was revived briefly in 1971.</p>
         <p align="justify">In 1983, <em>Mister Wizard's World</em> debuted on the then fledgling cable kid's network Nickelodeon, and ran for seven seasons, and then continued to air in reruns up until 2000, thus making it Nick's all-time longest running show. It had 78 episodes to its credit.</p>

         <p align="justify">On all his shows, Mr. Wizard sought not make science accessible to everyone, and show kids how to perform scientific tricks with everyday materials, and to encourage them to ask questions about the world around them. Many people have credited Mr. Wizard with their career choices in science or computers.</p>
         <p align="justify">Perhaps Mr. Wizard represents the differences between Nick then and now, because Mr. Wizard never talked down to kids, or underestimated their intelligence.</p>
