         <p align="justify">This was a claymation segment that originated from Thames Television (England) in the early 1970s. All the characters were literally hats, except Carrots, who was a donkey. This was a narrated show, and slow paced. Sancho would get Carrots to move by hanging a carrot in front of him, enticing him to follow it. I have been told there were a total of 36 episodes made.</p>
