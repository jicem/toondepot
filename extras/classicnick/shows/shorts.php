        <p align="justify">There were many, many different shorts and skits that aired on Pinwheel. Most were of foreign origin. Here I will share with you what I remember of these. If anyone has any info on them, I would greatly appreciate it.<br>

         <p align="justify">There was a short where a little girl watered a plant and it grew and blossomed very quickly.</p>
         <p align="justify">There was a mouse on Mars. This short aired on most episodes on Pinwheel. This mouse also had relatives who lived on Earth.</p>
         <p align="justify">There were several live action skits of little girls practicing ballet.</p>
         <p align="justify">There were skits of kids singing the Pinwheel theme song.</p>
         <p align="justify">There were clay worms that crawled around. They would form shapes and &quot;talked&quot; to each other by putting their &quot;faces&quot; together. They also aired on &quot;Eureka's Castle&quot;.</p>
         <p align="justify">There was one short of a boy who found a paper towel core, and used it as a telescope. I remember it blew away or something and ended up getting run over by a car and flattened out.</p>
         <p align="justify">There was also a cartoon of a centipede that walked across the screen and would divide up.</p>
         <p align="justify">There was one that showed a bunch of kids at a community pool, and when they jumped in they yelled out &quot;Pinwheel&quot; and the theme song would start.</p>
         <p align="justify">There was also a short where a little girl picked a bouquet of flowers and took them to her grandmother. </p>
