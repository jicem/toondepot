         <p align="justify"><strong>Explaining it All</strong></p>
         <p align="justify"><em>Clarissa Explains It All</em> was a witty show from the early '90s that dealt with the trials and tribulations of growing up, as experienced by a teenage girl. Clarissa would tell the audience about her life, and would almost always have an explanation for it (hence the title of the show). Her parents where former hippies, and her interaction with them made for some humorous moments.<br>
         </p>
         <p align="justify">In addition to her parents, there was also her annoying, suck up brother Ferguson (&quot;Ferg-Face&quot;), whom many could relate their own annoying siblings.</p>
         <p align="justify">Through it all, Clarissa did have her best friend Sam, who usually climbed in through her bedroom window to talk to her. Everyone remembers the music that was played when he entered. Sam considered himself a neglected child, but he was a loyal and trusted friend.</p>
         <p align="justify">Clarissa was an excellent series, and one that is definitely missed. I would love to see a reunion of it. Melissa Joan Hart (Clarissa) is now the star of the hit series <em>Sabrina The Teenage Witch</em>.</p>
