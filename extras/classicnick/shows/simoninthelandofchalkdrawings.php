         <p align="justify">This show was about a boy named Simon, who liked to draw on a chalkboard. Then he would go outside, climb over a fence, and what he drew came to life. He had a friend named Henry, who was a chalk drawing. There was a parody of this show on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> starring Michael Myers.</p>
