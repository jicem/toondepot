         <p align="justify"><em>Kid's Court</em> was a simulated court run by kids. It was hosted by Paul Provenza, and the cases were based on letters they received, and the plaintiff and defendant would represent the different viewpoints of the letters. During the show, they were both allowed to state their case, and answer questions from the audience. At the end, the audience would vote on who was right by clapping their hands, and the &quot;Honorable Judge O'Meter&quot; would measure who got the most noise. After the ruling, host Paul Provenza would ask for suggestions from kids from the audience on what the guilty party's sentence should be. He would get about four suggestions, and then they would vote on which one in the same manner.</p>
         <p align="justify">Kid's Court always closed with &quot;sound-offs,&quot; when kids from the audience would tell what happened that was unfair to them, and then everyone in the audience would yell unfair. Kid's Court was also a part of &quot;Cable in the Classroom&quot;, a gimmicky campaign where teachers were encouraged to tape shows and air them for their classes. </p>
