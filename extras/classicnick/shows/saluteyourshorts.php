         <p align="justify"><em>Salute Your Shorts</em> was a fun comedy that aired on Nick in the early 1990s. It was  about a group of kids at summer camp, and their adventures there.</p>
         <p align="justify">One of the shows ongoing plots was the kids always trying to annoy their counselor Kevin &quot;Ugh&quot; Lee. They usually succeeded, as Ugh was a little on the dense side to begin with. There was also the enigmatic Dr. Con (I guess that's how he spelled his name), who was never seen, but his voice was always heard making announcements over a speaker system. Midway through the series, Michael caught chicken pox and has to leave camp. He never returns, instead going to Europe. He is replaced by Pinskey, a character very who is similar to him.<br>
         </p>
         <p align="justify">Among the other characters were: the dimwitted Donkeylips, the rich, spoiled Dina, the annoying jerk Budnick (who turns out to be a decent person), the athletic Telly, Z.Z., and the smart kid Sponge.</p>
         <p align="justify">All in all, Salute Your Shorts was one of the best live-action shows ever produced by Nick, up there with <em>Hey Dude</em>, <em>Clarissa Explains it All</em>, and <em>The Adventures of Pete and Pete</em>.</p>
