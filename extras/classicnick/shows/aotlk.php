		 <p align="justify">This show was produced originally in Japan, and was later shown on Nick, usually during the early afternoon. An early mainstay in Nick Junior, the show was set in a magical land where all the animals spoke the same language and were friends. <em>Adventures of the Little Koala </em> focused on the adventures of Roo Bear, and his family, who were Koalas, and his friends, Nick, Pamie (penguins), Floppy, Mimi (rabbits), Betty (koala), the bully Walter (kangaroo) and countless others. There was also an old character named Weather, who could forcast the weather, and his gliding friend Mingle, a young animal who was apparently an orphan. The show always had an &quot;innocent&quot; appeal, giving it a charm that is not seen very often in shows today. There were 52 episodes to its credit. Since each episode only lasted about 12 minutes two were shown at a time.
