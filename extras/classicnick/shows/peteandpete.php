         <p align="justify"><strong>Pete and Pete</strong></p>
         <p align="justify">Pete and Pete were first seen on Nickelodeon in the 1980s and short, five minute segments. The segments were well-received, so they began to give them full length &quot;specials&quot;, the first of which was &quot;What We Did On Our Summer Vacation&quot;. This eventually led to several more specials, all of which were very popular, so finally Pete and Pete got their own weekly series. It premiered on Nick in 1993, and lasted three seasons.</p>
         <p align="justify">The show centered around Pete, Pete, Ellen (&quot;You're a girl, and you're a friend, but you're not a girlfriend&quot;) adventures in a wacky town called Wellsville. Among the regulars were Artie &quot;The Strongest man in the world&quot; [played by Toby Huss], and their neighbor Nona Mecklenberg [played by Michelle Trachtenberg].</p>
         <p align="justify">Pete and Pete, in many ways, was a silly show. It employed dark humor, and was in the style of <em>Eerie, Indiana</em>.  </p>
