         <p align="justify"><em>Star Trek: The Animated Series</em> was basically the same as the original live-action television show except for the fact that it was a cartoon. It was interesting in that it often produced sequels to episodes of the live-action show. It also incorporated the original actors from the show to do the voices of their animated incarnations.</p>
         <p align="justify">Unfortunately, when it originally aired, TAS was doomed to failure. The show would have had a great deal of appeal to adults if it aired in a prime-time line up. Instead it was relegated to Saturday morning line up, and thus went over the heads of many of the kids who watched.</p>
         <p align="justify">TAS is sometimes known as &quot;the forgotten Star Trek,&quot; which really is tragic, because it was indeed a great show.</p>
