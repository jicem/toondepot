         <p align="justify"><em>Bananaman</em> premiered on Nick in 1983, and aired on Nick throughout the 1980s, usually directly following<em> Dan</em>ger Mouse. The segments were only about five minutes in length, and soon developed a huge cult fan following.</p>
         <p align="justify"> Bananaman was Eric Twinge by day, a skinny, normal (some would say nerdy) school boy. But when Eric ate a banana he became the superhero crime fighter Bananaman, who could fly, or rather, swim through the air. Bananaman was incompetent, but loads of fun to watch, as he bumbled his way to solving crime and capturing vile villans. He wasn't alone. His most notable allies were police chief O'Reilly, Crow, and Appleman. When Bananaman was in need of more strength, Crow (who was literally a crow) would give him another banana, and he would become stronger, much like Popeye and spinach. Bananaman's arch enemies included: General Blight, Auntie, Weatherman, and others. Like any good superhero, he also had a love interest. Bananaman was always trying to impress the lovely reporter Fiona. </p>
         <p align="justify">Bananaman was British in origin, and was based on the  character from the comic book <em>Nutty</em>. The animated series was made from 1983-1984 in England, and was imported to the U.S. by Nickelodeon. Bananaman also had his own Summer Specials in the 1990s. I've been told this show still airs occasionally in Australia.</p>
         <p align="justify">Reader Billy has informed me that the comic book <em>Nutty</em>  merged with another comic <em>Dandy</em> in 1985, and is still being published in England. </p>
