        <p align="justify">One of the least remembered shows from Nick's Golden Age, <em>Against the Odds</em> focused on people who made a difference in their field of study. Generally, these were inspirational takes of &quot;everyday folks&quot; overcoming huge odds in order to do so (thus, the name of the show). Usually historical figures. </p>
