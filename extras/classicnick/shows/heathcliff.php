         <p align="justify">The adventures of the orange tabby. Heathcliff was something of a bully, but appealed because of his rebellious nature. He like to bully Spike (a neighborhood dog), and hung around with Hector, Mungo, and Wordsworth (The Catillac Cats).</p>
         <p align="center"><img src="Image48.jpg" width="294" height="203"></p>
         <p align="justify">Heathcliff was the family pet of the Nutmeg family, which consisted of Pop, Grandma, and Iggy. Grandma loved Heathcliff, which had a tendacy to to annoy Pop to no end, and served as fuel for their ongoing &quot;rivalry&quot;.</p>
         <p align="justify">Heathcliff usually lasted about 11 minutes, so the second half of the show was dedicated to Heathcliff's friends the Catillac Cats, and their leader Riff-Raff. They were stray cats who lived in a junkyard guarded by an incompetent guard dog named Leroy, who often tried to force them out, but to no avail. Even so, Leroy was often an ally to them.</p>
         <p align="justify">Riff-Raff's girlfriend was named Sonja, and she lived in a music store with another incompetent dog named Bush.<br>
           wenlar supplies this information: &quot;This series was another france/japan co-production, but since it was based on an american comic strip character, no one in the US seemed to notice. Anyway, i managed to salvage these names from the neary-undecipherable credits: </p>
