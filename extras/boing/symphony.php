In <B> Gerald McBoing Boing's Symphony </B> Gerald is still working for the 'Bong! Bong! Bong!
radio show as the sound effects department.   The head of the station is in a frenzy because
 it is <img src=img/sym2.gif alt="Gerald and doctors " width=193 height=172 align=right>

almost time for the symphony program to begin and none of the orchestra members are at the 
station yet.

As Gerald walks past the owner he gets a brain storm, Gerald can do all the parts of the 
orchestra!
&#160 Or can he? &#160 The owner isn't sure Gerald has the strengh, so he  summons the doctors; 
Turnpike, Heartburn, Von Moose, Von Bushwacker, Crankshaft, and old Dr. Suess to check him out. 
&#160
He passes the physical so Gerald goes on the air. 
 
<P>

Gerald gets the symphony score and his radio script mixed and sound effects get intertwined 
with the music<img src=img/sym4.gif alt="Gerald and station owner " width=188 height=141 align=right>
and the owner is so mad he  tosses Gerald out.

 &#160 But when the telegrams come and his 
performace is praised
by all the experts Gerald is given a raise by the station owner.  &#160 But all this didn't 
go to Gerald's head,
he didn't boast, like most, cause he dosen't speak words, he goes 'Boing! Boing! instead.
