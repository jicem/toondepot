<b>Gerald McBoing Boing</B> tells the story of a small boy who when he first tries to talk 
can only utter sound
effects like 'Boing! Boing! &#160 His parents are shocked and call in a doctor who says he has 
no cure for the noises.

Gerald soon goes to school but is sent home because he goes 'Cuckoo! &#160 He is rejected by
the other kids because
of the sounds and his parents are annoyed  so runs away from home in despair.

<P>

He then comes across the head of the 'Bong! Bong! Bong! radio 
station who hires Gerald as 
his entire sound effects department. &#160 Gerald parents are now proud of him, and he becomes 
rich and famous
because he dosen't speak words, he goes 'Boing! Boing! instead. <P> <img src=img/boing6a.gif alt="Gerald "  align=right>

<b>Gerald McBoing Boing</B> won the Academy Award as best animated short subject for 1950. &#160 The 
competition was an MGM Tom & Jerry cartoon <B>Jerry's Cousin</B>, and another UPA entry 
<B>Trouble Idemnity</B>
with Mr. Magoo. &#160 It was a major triumph for UPA--formal recognition of their groundbreaking
 efforts.<img src=img/creditsa.gif alt="Credits "  align=left>
<P>This film--one of the finest ever made--had an impact that was both immeadiate and 
long-lasting. 
&#160 The concept came from Dr. Suess, who as Theodore Geisel, had worked with some of the UPA 
staff
on army films during WWII. 
&#160 His story, and rhyming dialogue, was adapted for animation by
 Phil Eastman and Bill
Scott.  &#160 Director Bobe Cannon and designer Bill Hurtz's concept was--less is more--how few
lines could they use. &#160 

The action was charted, then the music written to that action before 
it was animated by Bill Melendez, Rudy Larriva, Pat Mathews, Willis Pyle, and Frank Smith. &#160<img src=img/boing7a.gif alt="Gerald with mom & dad " width=184 height=139 align=right>
Next Jules Engel and Herb Klynn added the bright, flat colors in the background, broken only by the 
sparest of "props."  &#160 Different colors were used to convey different moods thoughout the film.<P>
