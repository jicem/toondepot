Gerald and a couple of kids are playing at the start of, <B> Gerald McBoing! Boing! On Planet Moo</b>.
&#160 Suddenly a flying saucer appears and swopes down and the alien inside kidnaps Gerald and takes
him to Planet Moo.  &#160 Meanwhile, on planet Moo, the King is in confrence with his cabinet. &#160
They tell the King that they are almost broke and the King tells them of his plan. &#160

The King heard through the grapevine that the earth people are loaded and that they are a
 fun-lovin'
free-spendin' bunch who are bustin' their britches to get off the earth. &#160 He says that
 they are the logical ones
to get some of that gravy because, Moo has the best climate, best fishin' and the  prettiest 
girls. &#160
His plan is to kidnap an earthling and find more out about the earth.  <P>

When the kidnapped Gerald arrives the King starts to ask him questions. &#160 When
 Gerald goes 'Boing!
Boing!  Boing! the King thinking it is the earth language tries to comunicate by making sounds.
&#160 Asked what Gerald is saying, the King says, "He don't speak English." &#160 Asked how he knows
what Gerald is saying, 
the King replies,
"Cause I'm the King!" <img src=img/moo3.gif alt="gerald with the king & murdoch " width=197 height=148 align=left>&#160 Asked how come he's the king, he replies, "Cause I wear the King's 
hat, thats why!"<P>



The King then states they will return Gerald to the earth and invite the earthlings to come up and 
see them. &#160
Having no money for fuel, the King makes the surpreme sacrifice, and hocks his hat.  &#160
When they get to earth Gerald introduces the King and his sidekick, Murdoch, to the mayor, 
making sounds of course.
&#160 Then the King makes sounds also, <img src=img/moo5.gif alt="gerald, mayor, king and others " width=220 height=160 align=right>the mayor thinking it is the Moo language also starts 
making sounds. &#160
Everyone is going boniga! boinga! boinga! thinking they all understand each other.<P>

The King and Murdoch return to Moo. &#160 To get ready for the earthlings visits to Moo,
 the King tells Murduch that he will set up a school
to teach all the inhabitants of Moo to speak the earth planet langauge. &#160  
"So if you listen real close on a quiet night, you can hear coming from the planet Moo,
boinga! boinga! boinga! boinga! boinga! boinga!"
