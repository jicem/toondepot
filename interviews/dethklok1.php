<P><FONT size=4>Dethklok Talks About Metalocalypse</FONT></P><P><B><I><SPAN>Q: First, let’s start with the persistent rumors that Dethklok has signed a contract with the devil.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Can you finally put this to rest?</SPAN></I></B></P>
<P><B><SPAN>William Murderface: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>I’ll put you to rest.<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>Toki Wartooth: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>The devil is dildoes.<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>Nathan Explosion:<SPAN> <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>There is no such thing as the devil because there has to be a god in order for there to be a devil. And we all know there is no god.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>And if there were a GOD then he would have protected us from signing that deal with the devil.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>And now we’re stuck with a deal with some guy who doesn’t even exist.</SPAN><B><SPAN></SPAN></B></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B><I><SPAN>Q: If Dethklok is the heaviest band in the world, and also the most popular band in the world, what does that say about the world?</SPAN></I></B></P>
<P><B><SPAN>WM: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>I’d like to destroy world hunger by destroying the world.</SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>TW: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>I love questions, and dats a good one.<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>Skwisgaar Skwigelf: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>It means nothing because, heavy or not, the world is a black vortex of black Nothingness and I hate our audience.</SPAN><B><SPAN></SPAN></B></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B><I><SPAN>Q: The band has both the world’s fastest and second-fastest guitarists alive in it.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Is that a bit of overkill?</SPAN></I></B></P>
<P><B><SPAN>WM: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>I’ll overkill you.<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>TW: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>No, it’s “underlive.”<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Ha ha.</SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>SS: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>Not at all. As the fastest guitarist, I prefer to have someone a little worse at guitar in the band, like Toki.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Because I think you would takes it for granted that I am the best.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Like you get used to a room filled with the smell of roses until you go into a room with a rotting corpse smell – then you go back to the roses room and extra appreciates it a greats degrees better.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B><I><SPAN>Q: Is it too loud, or am I too old?</SPAN></I></B></P>
<P><B><SPAN>WM: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>I’m too fat.<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>TW: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>You gots hairs in your ears.</SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>Pickles: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>It is loud.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>It’s very loud.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Before each show I have liquid concrete poured into my ears so that I don’t cause permanent damage.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>You gotta protect your ears, anyone will tell you that.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>But what they don’t tell you is that you should protect other parts of your body from loudness – for example, we now have to travel with a gastroenterologist.</SPAN><B><SPAN></SPAN></B></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B><I><SPAN>Q: Nathan, you have a distinctive vocal style.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>What do you do to take care of your voice and still fill it with anger and hate</SPAN></I></B><B><SPAN>? </SPAN></B></P>
<P><B><SPAN>WM: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>I’m not Nathan.<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>NE: </SPAN></B><SPAN>Two words: Potato chips and chocolate milk. <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>I can go for days smoking and drinking and killing myself staying awake, but have a glass of chocolate milk and a handful of potato chips and I’m good to go.</SPAN><SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B><I><SPAN>Q: What’s heavier – your music or your lyrics</SPAN></I></B><I><SPAN>?</SPAN></I></P>
<P><B><SPAN>WM: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>The lyrsmusic…shut up!<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>TW: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>Oooh, good question, it’s like a two-parter.<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>Pickles: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>We had them professionally weighed recently and the difference is fractional. <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>But the lyrics actually were heavier.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>The one lyric that tipped the scales was “I have a hate horse torso whose face is a Corpse/ Lacerated innards and a ding dong doodily dorpse.” <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>Now that’s heavy.</SPAN><SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B><I><SPAN>Q: What kind of gear do you use?</SPAN></I></B></P>
<P><B><SPAN>WM: </SPAN></B><SPAN>Krank amps and Gibson guitars.</SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>TW: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>Gibson guitars and Krank amps, but Krank won’t give us no hoodies.</SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>SS: </SPAN></B><SPAN>Gibson guitars.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>I stick with my Explorer and Toki usually plays a V, Krank amps- right now I'm using the KRANKENSTIEN, Line 6 pedals, Digidesign plug ins.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>We gots endorsement deals with alls of them. We can wrecks dem all- they just give us more.</SPAN><B><SPAN></SPAN></B></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B><I><SPAN></SPAN></I></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B><I><SPAN>Q: What are your influences – musical and otherwise?</SPAN></I></B></P>
<P><B><SPAN>WM: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>Those awesome medical shows about really fat people and tumors.</SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>TW:</SPAN></B><SPAN> <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>Depression and wind.</SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>SS:<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>My influences is my parent. I hates her beyond beliefs.</SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>NE: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>I’d have to say I’ve influenced myself a lot. <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>I listen to myself on records sometimes and think, “I could do that...”<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>Pickles: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>The sound of drums influences me. <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>I say that I think because I am a drummer. <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>And cymbals.</SPAN><SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><I><SPAN></SPAN></I>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B><I><SPAN>Q: What will it take for Dethklok to “sell out”?</SPAN></I></B></P>
<P><B><SPAN>WM: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>We sell out every night, dildo.</SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>TW: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>We sells out every night.<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>NE: </SPAN></B><SPAN><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN>Selling out is a point of view thing. <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>I’ve redefined my word definitions of “selling out.”<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>I call it making things “more metal,” and now it’s impossible to sell out. <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>We don't sell out at all. <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>And we never will.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>I dare you to try.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Seriously.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Offer us any amount of money. <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>And we’ll take it. And we’ll make it “MORE METAL.”</SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B><I><SPAN>Q: Death and mayhem seem to follow the band.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Unlucky or cursed?<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Does it affect your music?</SPAN></I></B></P>
<P><B><SPAN>WM: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>Lucky!<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>TW: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>Dat’s life, deals with it.<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>Pickles:<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>Death happens whether or not we are there.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Though there does seem to be a little more when we are around.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>That’s why we have the audience sign “Pain Waivers” to get into our show.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>It basically states that the audience is signing their life away should something horrible and “death-inducing” happen during one of our shows.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>And we can’t be sued.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Pretty smart!</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B><I><SPAN>Q: What is life on the road like for Dethklok?<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Do you prefer the seclusion of the studio to the adoration of thousands?</SPAN></I></B></P>
<P><B><SPAN>TW:<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>Thousands?! You mean billions!<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>SS:<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>The way I looks at it is that you can’t f**k studio gear. <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>Well, you can.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>But it’s better to be on the road and f**k things there – there are more options and shapes.</SPAN><B><SPAN></SPAN></B></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B><I><SPAN>Q: What inspires Dethklok?</SPAN></I></B></P>
<P><B><SPAN>WM: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>A flower with its brains blown out.<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>TW:</SPAN></B><SPAN> <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>Everything must die.<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>NE:</SPAN></B><SPAN> <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>For me, it’s humor. <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>The fact that we are rich and that we will die eventually.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>See, that’s kind of funny to me.</SPAN><B><SPAN></SPAN></B></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B><I><SPAN>Q: Any thought about solo projects?<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>What does Dethklok do to relax?</SPAN></I></B></P>
<P><B><SPAN>WM: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>My solo project is called Planet Piss.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>Like it or not, who gives a piss?<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>TW: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>I likes to answer questions and build models.<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>SS: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>We relax with alcohol and Drug Buckets. <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>And everybody’s working on solo stuff always.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>That’s cool. <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>I’m in a Harry Potter tribute band called “10 Points to Gryffyndor.” Also, I’m in a nudist Civil War styled band called “Depantsification Proclamation.”</SPAN><B><SPAN></SPAN></B></P>
<P><B><SPAN></SPAN></B>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B><I><SPAN>Q: Is Dethklok’s music art?</SPAN></I></B></P>
<P><B><SPAN>WM: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>When it’s painted on your face.<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>TW: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>We gots an album cover of a Mona Lisa with blood.<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>SS: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>Art is stupid.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>There is only food and death. <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>So to answer your question: our music is both food and death.</SPAN><B><SPAN></SPAN></B></P>
<P><SPAN></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P><B><I><SPAN>Q: Much is made about Dethklok’s penchant for pain and metal.<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN>But what about the groupies? Are there special ladies in the lives of Dethklok?</SPAN></I></B></P>
<P><B><SPAN>WM:<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>You mean like retarded?<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>TW: <SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>I don’t wears no penchant.<B></B></SPAN></P>
<P><B><SPAN>SS:<SPAN>&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></B><SPAN>I have no recollection of most of the women that I’ve slept with except for the paternity suits, which are null simply because they must sign a “fatherhood waiver,” before a screw.</SPAN><B><SPAN></SPAN></B></P><br>Source: Cartoon Network Pressroom (Now defunct)</span>
