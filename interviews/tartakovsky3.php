<P><FONT size=4>Genndy Tartakovsky Talks About Star Wars: Clone Wars (Again)</FONT></P><P ><STRONG>What did you think of the fan and public reaction to the first 10 episodes of <I>Star Wars: Clone Wars</I>?</STRONG></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >I’ve been pretty pleased with most of the things I have heard.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>The responses I have heard from kids have been the best.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>They really liked it.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>I heard about one couple that recorded all the episodes and they use it as a bribery tool – if their kid is good, they’ll let him watch an episode.</P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P ><B>And what about from the hardcore Star Wars fans?</B></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >It’s also been pretty positive.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>I think the biggest complaint has been the time.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>Everyone wanted them to be longer.</P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >But overall everyone has been happy with all the action and the way that we portrayed the characters.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>At least that’s what I’ve learned from talking to people and on the Internet.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>Of course, there are always going to be people who don’t like something.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>But it seems like about 90 percent of the people really liked it.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P ><STRONG>A major new villain, General Grievous, is introduced iun Chapter 20 and will play a major role in the upcoming feature, Star wars: Episode III.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>How did you feel about that experience?</STRONG></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >Introducing the new character of General Grievous is an awesome responsibility.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>Working with the great characters of the <I>Star Wars</I> universe was humbling to all of us on the crew of <I>Star Wars: Clone Wars</I>, but helping to create a new character that will enter the mythology has made us truly feel a part of the <I>Star Wars</I> family.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>The fact that he is a powerful villain made it even cooler.</P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P ><B>There are a lot of characters in the next batch of episodes that will be new to the casual Star Wars fan – like Barris Offee and Luminara Unduli.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>Why did you choose to bring them into the story at this point?</B></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >We briefly saw these characters in <I>Star Wars</I> Episode II <I>Attack of the Clones</I> and thought they were really cool.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>So we decided to build a couple of episodes around them. </P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >We always loved the idea of where the crystals that power the lightsabers come from.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>And of course, during war, someone would always sabotage the supplies, so that’s where this story comes from.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>The Sepratists want to destroy the Jedi crystals so that the Jedi would not have powers.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>So that’s where that story originates – so we can see the Jedi Caverns on Ilum.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >It’s part of the classic Star wars lore that we all kind of knew about.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>It was a mystery that we wanted to explore.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>All these stories have originated from things we’ve always wondered about.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>Everything flowed really easily.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>We didn’t have to do much research.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>It was embedded in us.</P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P ><B>How has this affected your relationship to <I>Star Wars</I> as a fan?</B></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >It’s still fun to look at it, but I’ll need some time off of it before I go back and re-watch any of the things I’ve already seen – including <I>Star Wars: Clone Wars</I>.</P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P ><B>What about George Lucas’ reaction?</B></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >It’s been really great. I heard that he said that it is <I>Star Wars</I>, which is what we set out to do: to create really cool action cartoons that fit into the <I>Star Wars</I> story.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>He’s been really happy about it, especially because his kids like it too, which is important.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P ><STRONG>Are there any differences in the tone between the first ten episodes, which aired in November 2003, and the final ten, which air this spring?</STRONG></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >I think once we get to the last three episodes, the tone gets much darker because the stakes are much higher.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P ><B>Do you have a favorite chapter?</B></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >My favorites are Chapters 12 and 13 – the ones with Mace Windu.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>That huge seismic tank is brand new. It is one of the first ideas that I had on this project.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P ><B>What was your favorite character to bring into the animated realm?</B></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >It was fun to do Yoda.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>He’s kind of cute, and in these episodes you get to see how tough he is.<SPAN >&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN>They did this in the movies, but we push the concept even further.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >And then Mace was really fun to do. It’s just a lot of action, so we were able to really explore Jedi powers.</P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P ><B>How does this prepare viewers for what’s coming in the next movie?</B></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >Most of the series have been stand-alone episodes, but in the last episode there is a surprise that ties into the next movie.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P ><STRONG>You really spent a lot of time making sure that, in addition to looking like <I>Star Wars</I>, it sounded like it, too.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>Why so much emphasis on the sound and music?</STRONG></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >In the Star Wars universe, so much relies on the sound.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>Even as an adult, we can all remember the sound of a lightsaber.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>The sounds that R2-D2 makes are so particular. </P>
<P ><SPAN ></SPAN>&nbsp;</P>
<P >As we started this project, we knew we’d have to spend a lot of energy to make the sound stand out.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>And in television, all the sound is kind of squashed.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >We really had to plan out how we would balance the music and sound effects.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>We had to keep it a little more open – so that if we had a big fight sequence, we would stick to just sound effects.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>If the scene is more emotional, we’d go with just music.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>We had to break it apart a little more than if we were making a feature, where there is room in the dynamic range for both things.</P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >Having access to the Lucas library was the key, because it let us make everything sound authentic.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P ><STRONG>There seem to be more characters and locations involved in the final ten chapters than we saw in the first ten.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>Was that a deliberate part of your plan?</STRONG></P>
<P ><SPAN >In the beginning, we needed to set up the big overall story, so we kept the first 10 chapters simple and linear.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>If we jumped around too much in the beginning, we thought it would be too distracting.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN></SPAN></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >The first 10 play out very straight and orderly.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>We remind everyone of the story in Chapter 11 and Chapters 12 though 16 are separate stories.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>We move around a lot.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>Then Chapters 17 through 20 build to a big finish.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P ><B>Were there any big themes that you wanted to weave through the entire “epic micro-series”?</B></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >Really, we just wanted good stories and lots of action.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>As the story with Anakin and Asajj builds, there is a little more intensity that comes out, character-wise.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>It gets more emotional.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>The episodes with Mace Windu are just a lot of fun.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P ><STRONG>How has this experience changed the way you approach your craft – in terms of storytelling, how to build action sequences and how long a cartoon needs to be?</STRONG></P>
<P ><STRONG>&nbsp;</STRONG></P>
<P >I think that working in a limited time frame taught me how to really boil down storytelling to the most essential bits.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>Where we could stretch out in <I>Samurai Jack</I>, here we had to distill everything – to make it much, much shorter and have the same emotional impact.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >The ability to finesse dialogue was a big issue as well.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>We really had to be much more precise with the words to fit into the time frame.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>We had to condense it into its perfect form<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>- to say nothing more than needs to be said, but also nothing less.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >It was also useful to work on someone else’s characters.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>It was kind of difficult.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>For most of my career, I have worked on my own stuff or things I have helped create.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN>This was hard – to do justice to someone else’s creation.<SPAN >&nbsp; </SPAN></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P ><B>What’s next for you now?</B></P>
<P >&nbsp;</P>
<P >I want to work on an animated feature, but I’ll need a little time off to think after this.</P>
