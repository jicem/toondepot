text=Produced in 1967 for RKO-Jomar, this Hanna-Barbera cartoon followed the same route taken by the Laurel and Hardy cartoons from the previous year. The animated version of the Bud Abbott and Lou Costello comedy team was unique in the fact that Bud Abbott (1895-1974) himself provided the voice for his animated counterpart. In fact, the cartoon residuals were Abbott's main source of income during his illness riddled later years. The voice of his partner, Lou Costello (1906-1959), was provided by Stan Irwin. These cartoons failed to capture the magic of the duo's live-action films, and the 156 episodes were only seen in a limited number of markets.
