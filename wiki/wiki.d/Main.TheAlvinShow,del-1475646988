text=!!Alvin%0a%0aOriginally seen on CBS-TV in prime time from October 14, 1961 through September 12, 1962, The Alvin Show was based on the popular Chipmunk records.  The records were sung by Ross Bagdasarian, who supplied the voices of David Seville and all three of the electronically altered Chipmunks.  Bagdasarian first employed the technique of recording singing voices at a slow speed, then playing them back twice as fast, for his 1958 hit record "Witch Doctor".  Bagdasarian's children, Carol, Ross Jr., and Adam reportedly thought the sped up voices sounded like chipmunks.  Bagdasarian, who originally planned to make the characters rabbits or butterflies, listened to his children and introduced Alvin, Theodore and Simon later in 1958 on "The Chipmunk Song".  The recording was a smash hit, selling more than four million copies just seven weeks after it's release.%0a%0aBagdasarian recorded exclusively for Liberty Records and named the three Chipmunks after Liberty executives Al (Alvin) Bennett, Si (Simon) Warnoker and recording engineer Ted (Theodore) Keep.  The Chipmunks were such a success that imitators, such as The Grasshoppers and [[The Nutty Squirrels]], sprang up.%0a%0aRoss Bagdasarian (1920 - 1972) was a multi-talented performer from the Armenian-American community in Fresno, California. His family owned vineyards that were associated with Sierra Wines.  He had been a stage actor in the original 1939 production of Time Of Your Life, penned by playright William Saroyan, who was Bagdasarian's first cousin. He then moved on to singing and composing (he wrote the 1953 Rosemary Clooney hit "Come On-a My House"), and even appeared as a struggling songwriter in Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 classic Rear Window.  Shortly after the Chipmunks initial success, Bagdasarian was approached by CBS-TV's The Ed Sullivan Show and asked to appear with the Chipmunks. He contacted animator and puppeteer Bob Clampett, who created hand-puppet Chipmunks and assisted Bagdasarian during the appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show.%0a%0aWith the success of the Chipmunks, plans were made to produce the animated cartoon series.  Herbert Klynn's Format Films was chosen as the animation studio and preliminary plans were made for the series. Format hit a snag during the development stage and ran into numerous delays and unsuccessful attempts to create visual counterparts of the Chipmunks.  Format eventually came up with suitable renditions of the characters and farmed out some of the animation work to Jack Kinney Productions. This delay enabled The Nutty Squirrels, a Chipmunk imitator, to arrive on TV in animated form a full year before Bagdasarian's The Alvin Show.  The 26 episodes eventually appeared October 14, 1961, as part of CBS-TV's Wednesday night line-up.%0a%0aThe series dealt with the animated adventures of Dave Seville, a song-writing bachelor, and his three musically inclined chipmunk charges.  Alvin was the egotistical, baseball cap wearing  leader of the sweatshirted trio; Theodore was the chubby, giggling member; and Simon was the brainy member.  They were constantly getting into mischief, initiated by Alvin, and forever frustrating poor Dave.  Dave usually showed his displeasure with the antics of Alvin by emitting a loud "Al-l-l Vin-n-n!" yell. Each episode also included a Chipmunk song, a sing-a-long segment, and the misadventures of the great inventer, Clyde Crashcup.%0a%0aThe series failed to find a sizeable audience in prime-time, and was cancelled after the first season.  CBS reran the series on Saturday mornings from September 23, 1962 through September 18, 1965.  It then went into syndication, first through CBS Films and eventually through Viacom.  NBC-TV revived the original series on March 10, 1979, rerunning it on Saturday mornings until September 1, 1979.%0a%0aProduced by Format Films for Bagdasarian Film Corporation.%0aExecutive Producer - Herbert Klynn.%0aAssociate Producer - Leo Salkin.%0aProduction Executive - Bud Getzler.%0aDirectors: Osmond Evans, Rudy Larriva, Gil Turner and Alan Zaslove.%0aStory by Leo Salkin, Cal Howard, Bob Kurtz, Ed Nofzinger, Dale Hale, Jan Strejohn,%0aAl Bertino, Jack Cosgriff, Bill Danch, Chris Jenkyns, Dick Kinney and Ted Pierce.%0aArt Director - Jules Engel.%0aProduction Design - Sam Weiss, Vern Jorgensen, Ernie Nordli, Dale Barnhart and Cullen Houghtaling.%0aMusical Direction - Johnny Mann.%0aOriginal Music - Ross Bagdasarian.%0aVoices:%0aRoss Bagdasarian (Alvin/Simon/Theodore/Dave Seville/Sam Valiant)%0aShepard Menkin (Clyde Crashcup)%0aJune Foray (Daisy Belle and other voices)%0aLee Patrick (Mrs. Frumpington)%0aJoe Besser (Dragon)%0aOther Voices - Paul Frees, Bill Lee, Johnny Mann, William Sanford%0a%0a!!Clyde Crashcup & Leonardo%0a%0aVoiced by Shepard Menken (doing an almost perfect imitation of comic actor Richard Haydn's "Edwin Carp" character), inventor Clyde Crashcup and his whispering, balding assistant, Leonardo, appeared on Format Films' 1961-1962 Alvin Show on CBS-TV prime-time.
